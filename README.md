## 💡 Why I Built This
I’m currently learning machine learning, but I wanted to build small, fun projects to improve my Python programming and get more comfortable with full-stack workflows.

This project was a perfect way to:
- Practice backend logic in Python
- Learn FastAPI in a real-world way
- Combine it with frontend skills I already have (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Prepare myself for deploying real projects
